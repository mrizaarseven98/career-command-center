## Short Description

Find, tailor, and track career applications with an evidence-led Codex workflow.

## Long Description

Career Command Center gives Codex a structured workflow for job and PhD searches. A native macOS companion app guides document intake, preferences, application tracking, archiving, deletion, and automation settings. Codex audits the user's evidence, builds role-family master CVs, verifies live opportunities, creates tailored CV and cover-letter packages, and keeps one recurring search automation synchronized.

The workflow starts without assumptions about profession, target roles, countries, seniority, or schedule. It asks the user to supply their own documents and preferences, separates verified evidence from unverified claims, and requires review before any application material is used. Career files and app state remain in a workspace chosen by the user.

2. Finish Career Command Center setup and build my evidence foundation.

## Release Notes

Version 1.2.1 fixes native macOS app installation after plugin download or marketplace transfer. The installer now restores transfer-sensitive launch permissions, locally re-signs and verifies the copied app, and can run its source-build fallback even when the build script's executable bit was removed. The release includes a regression test for the downloaded-archive failure mode and does not alter career documents or workspace state.
